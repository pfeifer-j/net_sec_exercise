    "\n",
    "DNS is can be used to bypass firewalls because it operates over port 53, which is often allowed through firewalls for essential network functionality. This makes DNS traffic a convenient channel for attackers to tunnel malicious data, evade traditional firewall rules. The difficulty in inspecting DNS traffic thoroughly without specialized tools also contributes to its popularity as an attack vector. Robust DNS monitoring and filtering solutions are necessary to mitigate these risks."

    "\n",
    "A DNS tunnel works by encoding data into DNS queries sent by a client to a DNS server. The server extracts this data from the queries and sends back responses that contain the encoded information or acknowledgments. The client then decodes the data from the server's responses, enabling covert communication through DNS channels, therby bypassing security measures."
